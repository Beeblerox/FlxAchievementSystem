{"name":"FlxAchievementSystem","tagline":"Achievements in Flixel","body":"The FlxAchievementSystem is a class built on Flixel that handles global achievements for individual games.\r\nIt utilizes flash's shared object (or FlxSave) to save achievement progress.\r\n\r\n##Quick Start\r\n\r\nThe FlxAchievementSystem is built out of 3 classes:\r\n- FlxAchievementSystem: The core class with all the important functions.\r\n- FlxAchievement: A simple class that stores individual achievement info like name, description, icon and state of progress (locked/unlocked).\r\n- FlxAchievementNotifier: A visual overlay that pops-up everytime you unlock an achievement.\r\n\r\nEverything you need to be good to go is a static instance of FlxAchievementSystem (it should be static so you can unlock achievements from anywhere in your project).\r\n\r\n###Set-Up\r\n\r\n#####1. Declare a static instance of FlxAchievementSystem (do this in your FlxGame class):\r\n```actionscript\r\npublic static var achievementSystem:FlxAchievementSystem;\r\n```\r\n\r\n#####2. Declare an array of achievements (all your achievements should go in here as adding them later would cause the savefile to corrupt):\r\n```actionscript\r\nprivate var achievements:Array =\r\n[\t\r\n    new FlxAchievement(\"My first achievement\", \"Description\"),\r\n    new FlxAchievement(\"My second achievement\", \"Description\")\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n#####3. In the constructor of your FlxGame class instantiate the FlxAchievementSystem:\r\n```actionscript\r\nachievementSystem = new FlxAchievementSystem(\"name of save\", achievements);\r\n```\r\n\r\n#####4. Last add the FlxAchievementSystem to the Flixel plugins (also in the FlxGame's constructor):\r\n```actionscript\r\nFlxG.addPlugin(achievementSystem);\r\n```\r\n\r\n###Unlocking Achievements\r\n\r\nTo unlock achievements simply call the unlock() function.\r\n\r\n###Erasing Progress\r\n\r\nTo erase the progress on the savefile call erase().\r\n\r\n##Contributing\r\nI highly encourage you to contribute to this project as I would love to improve it.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
